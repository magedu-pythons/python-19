NAME
       top - display Linux processes

SYNOPSIS
       top -hv|-bcHiOSs -d secs -n max -u|U user -p pid -o fld -w [cols]

       The traditional switches `-' and whitespace are optional.

DESCRIPTION
       The  top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can display system summary information as well as a
       list of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  The types of system summary  information  shown  and
       the  types,  order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be made
       persistent across restarts.

       The program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as well as a much more  extensive  interface  for
       personal configuration  --  encompassing every aspect of its operation.  And while top is referred to throughout this document,
       you are free to name the program anything you wish.  That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on top's  display
       and used when reading and writing a configuration file.
