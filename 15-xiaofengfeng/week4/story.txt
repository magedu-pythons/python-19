If not to the sun for smiling, warm is still in the sun there, but wewill laugh more confident calm; if turned to found his own shadow, appropriate escape, the sun will be through the heart,warm each place behind the corner; if an outstretched palm cannot fall butterfly, then clenched waving arms, given power; if I can't have bright smile, it will face to the sunshine, and sunshine smile together, in full bloom.
When you love who you are,you become a conduit of light.Just drop into your heart space,and live life from this view.For all of this doing is not who you are.Listen to your heart¡¯s soft whisper,this voice will show you the way.Live life from your essence is what she will say.See the light in yourself,and your world will be bright.There is no need to worry,you are exactly as you should be;remember to love who you are,and love you will see.
